Here's a simple Lambda function written in Python using AWS SDK (boto3) that identifies EBS 
snapshots not associated with any active EC2 instances and we will delete this snapshots using this scripts.

AWS Console Steps:
1. Create one EC2 instance and volume.
2. Create one snapshot of volume.
3. Create one Lambda function and Ensure the Lambda execution role has the necessary permissions for 
   ec2:DescribeSnapshots, ec2:DescribeVolumes, and ec2:DeleteSnapshot.

Python Scripts Steps:
1. List all EBS snapshots.
2. Check if each snapshot is attached to any running EC2 instance.
3. Delete snapshots that are not attached to any active instances.

This Lambda helps in deleting orphaned snapshots to save storage costs.
